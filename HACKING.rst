Sahara Specific Commandments
-----------------------------

Commit Messages
---------------
Using a common format for commit messages will help keep our git history
readable. Follow these guidelines:

- [S365] First, provide a brief summary of 50 characters or less. Summaries
  of greater then 72 characters will be rejected by the gate.

- [S364] The first line of the commit message should provide an accurate
  description of the change, not just a reference to a bug or blueprint.

Imports
-------
- [S366, S367] Organize your imports according to the ``Import order``

Dictionaries/Lists
------------------

- [S368] Must use a dict comprehension instead of a dict constructor with a
         sequence of key-value pairs. For more information, please refer to
         http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0274/
