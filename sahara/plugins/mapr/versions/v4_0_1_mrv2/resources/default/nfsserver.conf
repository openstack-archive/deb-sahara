# time we took to populate is greater than 50% of DrCacheTimeout.
# Set it to 0 to disable this optimization, Note that the DrCacheSize or
# DrCacheTimeout will also need to be changed. Ex: if the nfsserver supports
# 10,000 ops/sec (modification ops): then DrCacheSize will need to change
# to: 10,000*DrCacheTimeout = 620,000

#Auto refresh exports time interval in mins.
#default is 0, means there is no auto refresh.
