This value must be unique for the specific service. </li><li><code>triggerExpression</code> <strong>(mandatory)</strong> - A tsquery expression representing the trigger. </li><li><code>streamThreshold</code> <strong>(optional)</strong> - The maximum number of streams that can satisfy a condition of a trigger before the condition fires. By default set to 0, and any stream returned causes the condition to fire. </li><li><code>enabled</code> <strong> (optional)</strong> - By default set to 'true'. If set to 'false', the trigger will not be evaluated.</li><li><code>expressionEditorConfig</code> <strong> (optional)</strong> - Metadata for the trigger editor. If present, the trigger should only be edited from the Edit Trigger page; editing the trigger here may lead to inconsistencies.</li></ul></p><p>For example, the followig JSON formatted trigger fires if there are more than 10 DataNodes with more than 500 file-descriptors opened:</p><p><pre>[{\"triggerName\": \"sample-trigger\",\n  \"triggerExpression\": \"IF (SELECT fd_open WHERE roleType = DataNode and last(fd_open) > 500) DO health:bad\",\n  \"streamThreshold\": 10, \"enabled\": \"true\"}]</pre></p><p>See the trigger rules documentation for more details on how to write triggers using tsquery.</p><p>The JSON format is evolving and may change in the future and, as a result, backward compatibility is not guaranteed between releases at this time.</p>",
