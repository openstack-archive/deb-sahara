Code Reviews with Gerrit
========================

Sahara uses the `Gerrit`_ tool to review proposed code changes. The review
site is http://review.openstack.org.

Gerrit is a complete replacement for Github pull requests. `All Github pull
requests to the Sahara repository will be ignored`.

See `Development Workflow`_ for information about how to get
started using Gerrit.
