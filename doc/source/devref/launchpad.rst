Project hosting
===============

`Launchpad`_ hosts the Sahara project. The Sahara project homepage on
Launchpad is http://launchpad.net/sahara.

Launchpad credentials
---------------------

Creating a login on Launchpad is important even if you don't use the Launchpad
site itself, since Launchpad credentials are used for logging in on several
OpenStack-related sites. These sites include:

 * `Wiki`_
 * Gerrit (see :doc:`gerrit`)
 * Jenkins (see :doc:`jenkins`)

Mailing list
------------

The mailing list email is ``openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org``; use the
subject prefix ``[sahara]`` to address the team. To participate in the
mailing list subscribe to the list at
http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo

Bug tracking
------------

Report Sahara bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/sahara

Feature requests (Blueprints)
-----------------------------

Sahara uses specs to track feature requests. Blueprints are at
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sahara. They provide a high-level summary of
proposed changes and track associated commits. Sahara also uses specs for
in-depth descriptions and discussions of blueprints. Specs follow a defined
format and are submitted as change requests to the openstack/sahara-specs
repository. Every blueprint should have an associated spec that is agreed
on and merged to the sahara-specs repository before it is approved, unless the
whole team agrees that the implementation path for the feature described in
the blueprint is completely understood.

Technical support
-----------------

Sahara uses `Ask OpenStack`_ to track Sahara technical support questions.
Questions related to Sahara should be tagged with 'sahara'.
